# Getting Started with Managing MECM using PowerShell

If you're an IT professional or a system administrator responsible for managing a Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (MECM) environment, you know that automation and scripting can save you a lot of time and effort. PowerShell is a powerful tool for managing MECM, and in this blog post, we'll explore the basics of using PowerShell to perform common tasks in your MECM environment.

## What is MECM?

Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (MECM), formerly known as System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM), is a comprehensive management solution for deploying and managing Windows devices in an enterprise environment. It allows you to control software distribution, updates, and configurations across your organization's devices.

## Why Use PowerShell for MECM Management?

PowerShell is a versatile scripting and automation framework that integrates seamlessly with MECM. By leveraging PowerShell, you can:

- Automate repetitive tasks.
- Ensure consistent configuration and compliance.
- Scale your management efforts efficiently.
- Access advanced features not available through the graphical user interface.

## Prerequisites

Before you start managing MECM with PowerShell, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **MECM Console**: Ensure that MECM is correctly installed and configured, and you have access to the MECM console.

2. **PowerShell**: You'll need a working knowledge of PowerShell. If you're new to PowerShell, it's a good idea to start with some basic PowerShell tutorials.

3. **MECM PowerShell Module**: With the MECM Admin Console installed, the ConfigurationManager module is already available to you.  You can load this module using the following command:

   ```powershell
   Install-Module -Name ConfigurationManager
   ```

   This module provides cmdlets for interacting with your MECM environment.

## Connecting to MECM

Before you can manage MECM with PowerShell, you must run commands from the Configuration Manager drive, named after your site code.  I have found that it doesn't always connect to the CM drive after importing the module.  If this happens, connect to your drive using set-location :

```powershell
# Replace 'PS1' with your MECM Site Code
Set-Location "PS1" 
```

## Common MECM PowerShell Tasks

Let's look at some common tasks you can perform with PowerShell in MECM.

### 1. Listing Applications

You can use PowerShell to list all the applications deployed in your MECM environment:

```powershell
Get-CMApplication
```

This command will display a list of all applications, including their names, IDs, and other details.

### 2. Deploying Applications

To deploy an application to a collection of devices, use the `Start-CMApplicationDeployment` cmdlet:

```powershell
Start-CMApplicationDeployment -CollectionName "All Desktops" -Name "Adobe Reader"
```

This example deploys the "Adobe Reader" application to a collection named "All Desktops."

### 3. Creating a Software Update Group

You can create a software update group to manage Windows updates:

```powershell
New-CMSoftwareUpdateGroup -Name "Monthly Updates" -Description "Updates for the month of October"
```

This command creates a software update group named "Monthly Updates."

### 4. Scheduling Updates Deployment

Schedule the deployment of a software update group:

```powershell
Set-CMSchedule -ScheduleID "PS1" -OfferedSchedule "01/31/2023 03:00:00" -DeploymentType Available
```

This schedules a deployment of the software update group with ID "PS1" for January 31, 2023, at 3:00 AM.

## Conclusion

PowerShell is an invaluable tool for managing MECM efficiently. In this blog post, we've covered the basics of connecting to your MECM environment and performing common tasks using PowerShell. As you become more familiar with PowerShell and MECM, you can create custom scripts and automation routines to streamline your administrative tasks further.

Remember that MECM is a powerful tool with numerous features, and the MECM PowerShell module provides a wide range of cmdlets for managing these features. Explore the documentation and experiment with PowerShell to harness the full potential of MECM automation.

Happy scripting, and may your MECM management tasks become a breeze with PowerShell!
